	abstract = {Representing the absence of objects is psychologically demanding. People are slower, less confident and show lower metacognitive sensitivity (the alignment between subjective confidence and objective accuracy) when reporting the absence compared with presence of visual stimuli. However, what counts as a stimulus absence remains only loosely defined. In this Registered Report, we ask whether such processing asymmetries extend beyond the absence of whole objects to absences defined by stimulus features or expectation violations. Our pre-registered prediction was that differences in the processing of presence and absence reflect a default mode of reasoning: we assume an absence unless evidence is available to the contrary. We predicted asymmetries in response time, confidence, and metacognitive sensitivity in discriminating between stimulus categories that vary in the presence or absence of a distinguishing feature, or in their compliance with an expected default state. Using six pairs of stimuli in six experiments, we find evidence that the absence of local and global stimulus features gives rise to slower, less confident responses, similar to absences of entire stimuli. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the presence or absence of a local feature has no effect on metacognitive sensitivity. Our results weigh against a proposal of a link between the detection metacognitive asymmetry and default reasoning, and are instead consistent with a low-level visual origin of metacognitive asymmetries for presence and absence.},

However, patients also display general subclinical uncertainty, which may tempt vulnerable individuals to seek reassurance by perseveration in response to mild uncertainty that is superimposed on general uncertainty. An experimental eye-tracking paradigm was developed to investigate whether mild uncertainty indeed induces checking behavior in people with high obsessive-compulsive tendencies ({OC}+, n = 34), compared to people with low obsessive-compulsive tendencies ({OC}â, n = 31). Participants were presented 50 visual search displays, and they indicated whether a target was âpresentâ or âabsent.â Decisions about target presence induced little uncertainty, but decisions about its absence were more ambiguous, because participants relied on not having overlooked the target. Results revealed no differences on targetpresent trials. However, in target-absent trials, {OC}+ participants searched longer and used more fixations.

Results revealed that target-absent trials induced more uncertainty than targetpresent trials.

	abstract = {People with obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}) tend to distrust their memory, perception, and other cognitive functions, and many {OCD} symptoms can be traced to diminished confidence in oneâs cognitive processes. For example, poor confidence in recall accuracy can cause doubt about oneâs memory and motivate repeated checking. At the same time, people with {OCD} also display performance deficits in a variety of cognitive tasks, so their reduced confidence must be evaluated in relation to their actual performance. To that end, we conducted an exhaustive review and meta-analysis of studies in which {OCD} participants and non-clinical control participants performed cognitive tasks and reported their confidence in their performance. Our search resulted in 19 studies that met criteria for inclusion in the quantitative analysis, with all studies addressing either memory or perception. We found that both performance and reported confidence were lower in {OCD} than in control participants. Importantly, however, confidence was more impaired than performance in participants with {OCD}. These findings suggest that people with {OCD} are less confident in their memory and perception than they should be, indicating a genuine under-confidence in this population. We discuss potential mechanisms that might account for this finding and suggest avenues for further research into under-confidence and related meta-cognitive characteristics of {OCD}.},

We administered the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale [Personality and Individual Differences 17 (1994) 791] to 55 clinic patients with {OCD}, 43 of whom had checking compulsions, and 14 nonanxious controls. {OC} checkers showed greater {IU} than did {OC} noncheckers and {NACs}. The latter two groups did not differ from each other. Furthermore, both repeating and checking rituals were associated with {IU}.

            Awareness of oneâs own abilities is of paramount importance in adaptive decision making. Psychotherapeutic theories assume such metacognitive insight is impaired in compulsivity, though this is supported by scant empirical evidence. In this study, we investigate metacognitive abilities in compulsive participants using computational models, where these enable a segregation between metacognitive and perceptual decision making impairments. We examined twenty low-compulsive and twenty high-compulsive participants, recruited from a large population-based sample, and matched for other psychiatric and cognitive dimensions. Hierarchical computational modelling of the participantsâ metacognitive abilities on a visual global motion detection paradigm revealed that high-compulsive participants had a reduced metacognitive ability. This impairment was accompanied by a perceptual decision making deficit whereby motion-related evidence was accumulated more slowly in high compulsive participants. Our study shows that the compulsivity spectrum is associated with a reduced ability to monitor oneâs own performance, over and above any perceptual decision making difficulties.},

	abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk ({AMT}) is an online crowdsourcing service where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small sums of money. The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the {AMT} system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using {AMT}. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

Although there has been some research on the accuracy and reliability of response time measurements collected using {JavaScript}, it remains unclear how well this method performs relative to standard laboratory software in psychologically relevant experimental manipulations. Here we present results from a visual search experiment in which we measured response time distributions with both Psychophysics Toolbox ({PTB}) and {JavaScript}. We developed a methodology that allowed us to simultaneously run the visual search experiment with both systems, interleaving trials between two independent computers, thus minimizing the effects of factors other than the experimental software. The response times measured by {JavaScript} were approximately 25Â ms longer than those measured by {PTB}. However, we found no reliable difference in the variability of the distributions related to the software, and both software packages were equally sensitive to changes in the response times as a result of the experimental manipulations. We concluded that {JavaScript} is a suitable tool for measuring response times in behavioral research.},

	abstract = {This article suggests a theoretically driven explanation for a replication failure of one of the basic findings in psychology: the facial-feedback effect. According to the facial-feedback hypothesis, the facial activity associated with particular emotional expressions can influence peopleâs affective experiences. Recently, a replication attempt of this effect in 17 laboratories around the world failed to find any support for the effect. We hypothesize that the reason for the failure of replication is that the replication protocol deviated from that of the original experiment in a critical factor. In all of the replication studies, participants were alerted that they would be monitored by a video camera, whereas the participants in the original study were not monitored, observed, or recorded. Previous findings indicate that feeling monitored or observed reduces reliance on internal cues in making judgments. Therefore, we hypothesize that recording the participants in the replication experiments reduced their reliance on the facial-feedback. To test the hypothesis, we replicated the facialfeedback experiment in 2 conditions: one with a video-camera and one without it. The results revealed a significant facial-feedback effect in the absence of a camera, which was eliminated in the cameraâs presence. These findings suggest that minute differences in the experimental protocol might lead to theoretically meaningful changes in the outcomes. In our view, the theoretical and methodological approach advocated by our study changes failed replications from being the âend of the roadâ regarding entire fields of study into a new road for growth regarding our understanding of human nature.},

In six experiments, we show that judgments people make while they are in a subjective state of mind are more influenced by metacognitive experience compared with judgments people make when they are in an objective state of mind. This is demonstrated in Experiments 1â3, using two different manipulations for the two states of mind and two different fluency tasks. Experiment 4 explores the underlying mechanism and demonstrates that an objective state does not lessen the metacognitive experience itself; rather, it affects the reliance on this experience as a relevant source of information. Finally, in Experiments 5 and 6 we investigate implications of our hypothesis for doing experimental research in psychology. We find that taking part in a laboratory experiment resembles the experimental condition of an objective state of mind, as participants rely less on their metacognition compared with conditions aimed to restore the subjective state of mind within the lab setting. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings regarding social influences on judgments and decisions in psychology labs and in the real world.},

Response accuracy, number of verifications, and response time for choice taken to reflect the degree of uncertainty and doubt were recorded over 50 consecutive trials. Results: Despite similar levels of performance, patients with {OCD} demonstrated a greater number of verifications and a longer response time for choice before checking than {NV}. Such behavioral patterns were more pronounced in {OCD} subjects currently experiencing checking compulsions.

In Study 2, we further investigated the convergent and divergent validity of the {OCI}-R using a new sample of 221 students who completed a battery of measures of obsessiveâcompulsive symptoms, worry, and depression. There was a significant order effect for both the {OCI}-R and the {MOCI}: means of each measure were significantly lower when presented second. Despite the order effect, statistical analyses indicated that the {OCI}-R has adequate testâretest reliability for the full scale and subscale scores, solid factor structure, and high internal consistency. Convergent validity with other measures of obsessiveâcompulsive symptoms was moderate to excellent, and divergent validity was good.

To provide normative data for the general adult population. Design. Cross-sectional, correlational and confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}). Methods. The {DASS}-21 was administered to a non-clinical sample, broadly representative of the general adult {UK} population (N=1,794). Competing models of the latent structure of the {DASS}-21 were evaluated using {CFA}. Results. The model with optimal fit ({RCFI} = 0.94) had a quadripartite structure, and consisted of a general factor of psychological distress plus orthogonal specific factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. This model was a significantly better fit than a competing model that tested the possibility that the Stress scale simply measures {NA}. Conclusions. The {DASS}-21 subscales can validly be used to measure the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, each of these subscales also taps a more general dimension of psychological distress or {NA}.

	abstract = {The compulsive behaviour underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}) may be related to abnormalities in decision-making. The inability to commit to ultimate decisions, for example, patients unable to decide whether their hands are sufficiently clean, may reflect failures in accumulating sufficient evidence before a decision. Here we investigate the process of evidence accumulation in {OCD} in perceptual discrimination, hypothesizing enhanced evidence accumulation relative to healthy volunteers. Twenty-eight {OCD} patients and thirty-five controls were tested with a low-level visual perceptual task (random-dot-motion task, {RDMT}) and two response conflict control tasks. Regression analysis across different motion coherence levels and Hierarchical Drift Diffusion Modelling ({HDDM}) were used to characterize response strategies between groups in the {RDMT}. Patients required more evidence under high uncertainty perceptual contexts, as indexed by longer response time and higher decision boundaries. {HDDM}, which defines a decision when accumulated noisy evidence reaches a decision boundary, further showed slower drift rate towards the decision boundary reflecting poorer quality of evidence entering the decision process in patients under low uncertainty. With monetary incentives emphasizing speed and penalty for slower responses, patients decreased the decision thresholds relative to controls, accumulating less evidence in low uncertainty. These findings were unrelated to visual perceptual deficits and response conflict. This study provides evidence for impaired decision-formation processes in {OCD}, with a differential influence of high and low uncertainty contexts on evidence accumulation (decision threshold) and on the quality of evidence gathered (drift rates). It further emphasizes that {OCD} patients are sensitive to monetary incentives heightening speed in the speed-accuracy tradeoff, improving evidence accumulation.},
