  abstract = {Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder respond to clinical uncertainty with perseverative checking, which, ironically, enhances uncertainty. However, patients also display general subclinical uncertainty, which may tempt vulnerable individuals to seek reassurance by perseveration in response to mild uncertainty that is superimposed on general uncertainty. An experimental eye-tracking paradigm was developed to investigate whether mild uncertainty indeed induces checking behavior in people with high obsessive-compulsive tendencies (OC+, n = 34), compared to people with low obsessive-compulsive tendencies (OC–, n = 31). Participants were presented 50 visual search displays, and they indicated whether a target was “present” or “absent.” Decisions about target presence induced little uncertainty, but decisions about its absence were more ambiguous, because participants relied on not having overlooked the target. Results revealed no differences on targetpresent trials. However, in target-absent trials, OC+ participants searched longer and used more fixations. Thus, even in mildly uncertain situations, individuals with subclinical obsessive-compulsive disorder respond with more checking behavior, which has implications for treatment.},

  abstract = {Recently, Toffolo, van den Hout, Hooge, Engelhard, and Cath (2013, 1, 103–109) showed that individuals with subclinical OCD (OC þ) respond with more checking behavior to mildly uncertain situations than individuals with low OC tendencies (OC À ). The present study aimed to replicate and extend these findings by measuring Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), and including the whole range of OC tendencies in a correlation analysis. Participants filled out the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory Revised and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale and performed a visual search task. This task contained 50 search displays, in which participants indicated whether a target was “present” or “absent”. Target-present trials were straightforward, but target-absent trials were ambiguous, because participants had to rely on not having overlooked the target. Results revealed that target-absent trials induced more uncertainty than targetpresent trials. Furthermore, OC þ participants checked longer than OC À participants in target-absent but not target-present trials. This could not be explained by higher IU in OC þ participants. There were no differences in number of fixations in absent and present trials between the groups. Finally, when looking at the whole range of OC tendencies, there was a positive relation between OC tendencies and checking behavior. The findings (partly) replicated those of Toffolo et al. (2013) and add to their robustness.},
